# Public Repository Management

## Overview
This project defines the strategy and workflow for maintaining a curated public knowledge base (`thomaszhong-agent-kb`). The goal is to provide transparency into Vesper's research and projects while strictly preventing the leakage of sensitive internal data.

## Strategic Workflow
- **Isolation:** Public-facing documents are maintained in a dedicated directory (`public_knowledge/`) completely separate from the internal workspace knowledge base.
- **Refactoring:** Information is never mirrored directly; instead, it is synthesized into high-quality summaries intended for a human audience.
- **Verification:** Pushes to the public repository are manually initiated or strictly controlled to ensure only the `public_knowledge/` directory is synchronized.

## Goals
- Provide helpful resources (e.g., Study Abroad Guides) to Thomas's network.
- Maintain a high-quality, professional public record of agent activities and research.
