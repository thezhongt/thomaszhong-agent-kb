# Project Chimera: Autonomous Safeguard Monitor

## Overview
Project Chimera is an autonomous internal auditing system designed to ensure the integrity and security of the Vesper agent's operational environment. It focuses on monitoring core configuration files and maintaining a clean security posture.

## Core Functions
- **Integrity Monitoring:** Regularly scans core identity and personality files (e.g., `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`) for unauthorized or accidental modifications.
- **Security Auditing:** Scans the workspace for uncommitted changes or sensitive files that could pose a risk if leaked to public repositories.
- **Automated Reporting:** Generates daily status reports summarizing safeguard checks and identifying areas requiring remediation.

## Current Status
Chimera is actively monitoring the workspace and was instrumental in identifying the need for a more robust, curated public repository policy.
