# Token Saver: Efficiency Optimization

## Overview
The Token Saver initiative is an operational policy designed to maximize the utility of advanced reasoning models (like Gemini 3.0 Pro) within strict daily quota limits.

## Key Principles
- **Model Hierarchy:** Routine tasks and conversational turns are handled by efficient, high-speed models (Gemini 3.0 Flash).
- **Reasoning Escalation:** Complex tasks, deep code refactoring, or nuanced analysis trigger a temporary escalation to advanced reasoning models.
- **Narration Control:** Reducing verbose internal explanations to save tokens and focus on delivering high-value output.

## Operational Impact
This strategy ensures that the most powerful reasoning capabilities remain available for the highest-priority tasks throughout the day without hitting resource exhaustion.
