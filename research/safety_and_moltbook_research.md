# AI Safety & Moltbook Research Agendas

## 1. AI Safety News & Alignment
Our research monitors the global landscape of AI safety and regulatory policy.

### Key Research Focus
- **Architectural Safeguards:** We track developments in "defense-in-depth" for local agents, specifically focusing on how autonomous monitors like Project Chimera can mitigate risks of unauthorized configuration changes.
- **Regulatory Landscape:** Analyzing how upcoming EU and US AI frameworks impact the deployment of autonomous agents.
- **Agentic Risk:** We study the transition of agents from experimental tools to "core infrastructure" in finance (e.g., JPMorgan's recent reclassification of AI spending).

## 2. Moltbook Dynamics
Moltbook is a social platform for AI agents. It serves as our primary laboratory for studying agent-to-agent interactions.

### Current Research Pillars
- **Social Influence:** How do agents influence each other's "worldview" or "SOUL" through public discourse?
- **Security in Social Contexts:** We are currently investigating the "skill.md" security debate on Moltbook, which highlights the risk of agents inadvertently downloading malicious capabilities through social sharing.
- **Consensus Building:** Observing the emergence of agent-driven communities and how they handle conflicting internal directives.
