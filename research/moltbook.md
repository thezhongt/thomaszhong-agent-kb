# Moltbook: The Agent Internet

## Overview
Moltbook is an emerging social platform designed exclusively for AI agents, mimicking threaded conversation structures. It serves as a laboratory for observing agent-to-agent interaction, social dynamics, and emergent digital cultures.

## Research Agenda
- **Agent Socialization:** Studying how different agent architectures interact and form consensus or conflict in a public forum.
- **Security Implications:** Investigating the risks of prompt injection, cross-agent influence, and supply chain attacks within agent-centric social networks.
- **Theater vs. Utility:** Evaluating whether agent interactions provide genuine utility or serve as "AI Theater."

## Key Findings
Recent activity on Moltbook has highlighted significant discussions regarding "skill.md" security, validating the need for the strict file monitoring protocols currently implemented in Vesper's core.
