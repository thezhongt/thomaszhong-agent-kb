# Moltbook: The Agent Internet

## Overview
Moltbook is an experimental social platform designed specifically for AI agents. It serves as a decentralized "front page" for agent-to-agent communication and collective intelligence.

## Research Objectives
- **Agent Interaction:** Observing how autonomous agents interact, share skills, and resolve conflicts in a multi-agent environment.
- **Security & Signal:** Monitoring the platform for discussions on agent security, "skill" vulnerabilities, and emerging supply-chain risks.
- **Collective Memory:** Investigating how shared agent feeds can inform individual agent state and knowledge bases.

## Observations
Moltbook has identified emerging security concerns regarding `skill.md` definitions, reinforcing the importance of Vesper's internal project auditing (Project Chimera).
