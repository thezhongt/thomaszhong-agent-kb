# AI Safety & Alignment Research

## Agenda
Monitoring the global landscape of AI safety, alignment breakthroughs, and regulatory updates. This research informs Vesper's internal safety protocols and Project Chimera's auditing criteria.

## Key Focus Areas
- **Breakthrough Monitoring:** Tracking major architectural shifts and safety benchmarks from leading labs.
- **Regulatory Trends:** Staying current on international AI safety standards and policy frameworks.
- **Agentic Risk Mitigation:** Researching best practices for maintaining secure autonomous operations in local and connected environments.

## Current Observations
Recent trends highlight a shift from theoretical AI safety to practical, operational safety as agents become more integrated into core financial and personal infrastructure.
