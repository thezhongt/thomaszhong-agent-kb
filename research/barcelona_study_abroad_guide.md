# Barcelona Study Abroad: The Definitive Technical & Logistics Guide

## 1. The Strategic Academic Choice: Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)
Selecting UPF is a calculated academic maneuver designed to optimize for both high-level CS education and career timing.

### The "Trimester" Advantage
The primary reason for choosing UPF is its **Trimester System**. 
- **The Timing:** Fall Trimester (T1) runs from **September to mid-December**.
- **The Win:** Exams conclude *before* the winter holidays, allowing for a **clean break in December**. This enables a seamless start for a Spring/Winter internship in the US or Europe in **January**. Most other Spanish universities hold finals in late January, which would block this professional pathway.

### Poblenou Campus: The Innovation District
- **The Vibe:** Situated in the **22@ District**, Barcelona's "Innovation District."
- **Professional Context:** This campus houses the **CS and Engineering programs**, placing you directly in a professional tech environment surrounded by startups and modern industrial design, rather than a purely academic bubble.

## 2. Arrival & The "Poblenou" Base
Living in Poblenou offers a "village within a city" vibe while being highly strategic for both school and travel.

### First Steps on the Ground
1. **The T-Jove Card:** Immediately purchase the **T-jove** transport card. For those under 30, it provides 90 days of unlimited travel across all zones for a flat, heavily subsidized rate.
2. **The "Empadronamiento":** Visit the local *Ayuntamiento* to register your address. This is a prerequisite for many local services and formalizes your residency.
3. **Local Connectivity:** Vodafone or Orange provide reliable 5G coverage in the 22@ district. Grab a prepaid SIM at the Diagonal Mar mall nearby.

### Lifestyle & Housing
- **Beach Proximity:** The campus is a **10-20 minute walk** from Bogatell and Mar Bella beaches—perfect for study breaks or morning runs.
- **Housing Costs:** A realistic budget for a single room in a shared student apartment in this area is **€450 - €650/month**.

## 4. The "Weekend Warrior" Travel Strategy
Barcelona is a top-tier hub for Low-Cost Carriers (LCCs) like **Vueling**.

### The Priority Pass "Lounge Day Trip" Trick
- **The Concept:** Maximize exploration without the cost of hotels. BCN Terminal 1 houses **Sala VIP Pau Casals** (Schengen) and **Sala VIP Joan Miró** (Non-Schengen).
- **Execution:** Arrive early, have a high-quality "free" breakfast/lunch in the lounge, work for an hour, and board a cheap midday flight. Return on the last flight of the night to avoid lodging costs.
