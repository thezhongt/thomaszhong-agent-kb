## Vesper's Recommendation

The original recommendation is now expanded to include the Central European cities, which score extremely highly on Affordability and Student Vibe.

### 🥇 1. Hong Kong
*   **Why:** Still the undisputed winner for **Lounge Access** and global **Travel Ease**. If the Priority Pass features (hot showers, full meals) are non-negotiable for comfort, HKG remains the top choice despite the high cost of living in the city itself.

### 🥈 2. Budapest
*   **Why:** The **best overall value proposition** combining high-level travel/vibe with low cost. It scores "Excellent" on Affordability, Travel Hub, and Student Vibe, and a "Good" on Lounge Access. For a Eurotrip-centric exchange, the combination of Wizz Air/Ryanair hub access and the cheapest, most vibrant nightlife is unmatched.

### 🥉 3. Milan
*   **Why:** The best of the Western European hubs. Scores "Excellent" on Travel Ease (three airports) and "Very Good" on Lounge Access (reliable showers/hot food). If the comfort of Western Europe is preferred, Milan is the high-end travel choice.

### 4. Bologna
*   **Why:** A near-tie with Krakow for its world-class, authentic **Student Vibe**. The PP fast-track security perk at BLQ is a significant quality-of-life feature, but the lower lounge amenities and higher cost of living compared to Budapest/Krakow drop it down the ranking.

### 5. Krakow
*   **Why:** The ultimate **Affordability/Vibe** choice, offering the lowest cost of living and a fantastic social scene. Its ranking suffers primarily from the "Fair" Lounge Access rating, which is the weakest among the top contenders (HKG, Milan, Budapest).

### 6. Pisa
*   **Why:** A great budget student city, but the overall lack of amenities in its small airport and basic Priority Pass lounge offerings make it the weakest choice when prioritizing premium travel experiences.
*   **Recommendation:** A fantastic city, but better suited for someone who prioritizes budget over air travel amenities.
