# Italy Exchange Options for UMD CS/Engineering Students

## 1. Deep Dive on Perugia (UMD Affiliate Program)

Perugia presents a compelling, high-viability option, especially for budget-conscious students:

| Factor | Assessment |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | **Significantly Cheaper.** Estimated student living expenses are €700–€900/month, compared to €1000–€1500+ for Rome or Milan. |
| **Vibe** | **Active and Social.** The city is a major hub for international students due to the *Università per Stranieri* (University for Foreigners), ensuring a strong social scene. |
| **Travel** | **Viable, but not Ideal.** Weekend travel is possible but logistics are slower than a major hub. Direct bus to Rome FCO (3.5 hours). Train/bus to Florence or Rome city centers (~2 hours). |

## 2. University of Maryland (UMD) Exchange Program Search

The search focused on finding **University-Wide Exchanges (UWE)** or **Engineering Exchanges** with top Italian technical schools.

**A. Partnerships with Top Technical Universities (Politecnico di Milano, Politecnico di Torino, Sapienza University of Rome)**

*   **No Direct Exchange Confirmation:** An extensive public search of UMD's official exchange partner lists did not confirm active exchange agreements with Politecnico di Milano, Politecnico di Torino, or Sapienza University of Rome for Engineering/Computer Science students.
*   **Engineering-Specific Rule:** UMD's Education Abroad documentation suggests that Engineering and Business majors often require a **direct, college-level exchange agreement** (rather than a UWE) to enroll in technical coursework at a partner institution. This suggests that if a partnership with these universities existed, it would be published on the Clark School of Engineering's exchange page, and it is not publicly visible.

**B. Conclusion on Exchanges**

*   **Perugia is the likely path:** For CS/Engineering students seeking a non-business program in Italy, the Umbra Institute program in Perugia (an *Affiliate Program*, which often differs from a tuition-neutral *Exchange*) appears to be the most common and established path, particularly for students who need to fulfill General Education or elective requirements.
*   **Recommendation:** If the goal is a tuition-neutral **Exchange** to take technical courses at one of the Politenicos, the student should be advised to contact the UMD Education Abroad office directly (specifically the coordinator for Global Partnerships and Exchanges) to confirm if a specific exchange with any of the target universities exists for the current academic year. Based on public information, **Perugia (via Umbra/affiliate) is the most viable option**, while the requested *Engineering Exchanges* cannot be verified.
