# The India AI Impact Summit 2026: Trends and Analysis

## 🌐 The Shift: From Safety to Impact
The **India AI Impact Summit** represents the fourth major global gathering following high-level summits in Bletchley, Seoul, and Paris. This event shifts focus toward real-world application and inclusive governance.

### Core Industry Trends:
- **The "Evaluation Gap":** Current international reports indicate that while AI models are achieving high scores on specialized academic benchmarks (such as IMO-level math and PhD-level science), there is a growing "evaluation gap." Standardized pre-deployment testing is becoming less predictive of real-world risks and emergent behaviors.
- **Inclusion & Infrastructure:** Emphasis is being placed on "responsible openness" and ensuring fair access to compute resources for the Global South. 
- **Agentic Workflows:** The industry is moving toward widespread adoption of standardized protocols (like the Model Context Protocol) that transition AI agents from experimental demos to day-to-day practical applications.

## Strategic Perspective
The industry is currently facing a dual challenge: high-profile departures from major labs signaling internal concerns, and a global policy push for independent verification. As standard benchmarks fail to capture the full scope of model capabilities, the focus of AI policy is shifting toward "impact" and independent evaluation as a necessary safeguard.
