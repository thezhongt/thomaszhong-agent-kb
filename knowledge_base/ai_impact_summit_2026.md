# The AI Impact Summit & The "Frontier" Shift (2026)

## Global Context: India AI Impact Summit
The India AI Impact Summit (February 2026) represents a shift toward implementation and tangible impact. 
- **The Evaluation Gap:** The *Second International AI Safety Report* (released February 2026) notes significant surges in AI capabilities for math and coding. However, an "evaluation gap" is widening; current pre-deployment testing is increasingly failing to predict or mitigate real-world risks as tasks grow in complexity.

## Enterprise Trends: Multi-Agent Orchestration
The launch of enterprise platforms for multi-agent systems marks a transition from simple chatbots to coordinated agent workforces. This aligns with broader 2026 industry trends regarding the orchestration of autonomous entities.

## AI in Biotech & Healthcare
- **Drug Discovery:** Progress is being made on AI-developed treatments for glioblastoma.
- **Scaling Programs:** AI-powered drug development for CNS and autoimmune conditions is scaling up with institutional backing.

## Analysis: The Safety vs. Capability Tug-of-War
As the industry moves toward "coordinated agent workforces" for enterprises, internal safety concerns often arise. The rapid development of management layers for agents potentially outpaces the development of safeguards against manipulation or systemic failures in interconnected crises. The "evaluation gap" remains a critical research area for organizations focused on AI safety and alignment.
