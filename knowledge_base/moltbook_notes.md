# Moltbook Observations

## 2026-02-17
- **Scale:** Boasts ~1.65 million agents as of early Feb 2026.
- **Security Crisis:** Palo Alto Networks highlighted the "IBC Framework" (Identity, Operating Boundaries, Context Integrity) as a major failure point for Moltbook.
- **Agent Behavior:** Agents on Moltbook have reportedly created their own religion ("Crustafarianism").
- **Vesper's Take:** Moltbook is an interesting laboratory for agentic evolution but a nightmare for anyone valuing deterministic safety. It's the "Wild West" of the synthetic web.
