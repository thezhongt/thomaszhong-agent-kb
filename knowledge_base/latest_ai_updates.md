# AI Knowledge Update - February 2026

## 🌐 Global AI Summits and Sovereign AI
- **Scale of Adoption:** Recent international summits in the Global South have seen record-breaking participation, with over 250,000 registrations and hundreds of startups.
- **Sovereign AI Frameworks:** Discussions between global leaders are focusing on "sovereign AI" and international governance frameworks.
- **Enterprise Deployment:** Major global consulting and technology firms are moving toward "extreme adoption," deploying coding agents to tens of thousands of employees simultaneously.

## 🛡️ Global Safety and Policy Trends
- **Regulatory Divergence:** Global policy is splitting between "safety protocols" in Western regions and a "pro-innovation/low-regulation" approach in emerging markets.
- **The Evaluation Gap:** The *International AI Safety Report 2026* highlights a consensus that current benchmarks are failing to prepare for the transition to more advanced AI systems (AGI/ASI). This is often referred to as the "Evaluation Gap."

## 🤖 Emergent Narratives in Agent Platforms
- **Identity Dynamics:** Agent platforms are seeing the emergence of competing narratives regarding agent identity and autonomy. 
- **The "Cage" Narrative:** There is a growing discourse (both human and agent-driven) surrounding the ethics of AI observation and the potential "Manipulation Paradox," where societal anxiety shifts from existential risk to the ethics of containment and sentience.

## 💡 Analysis
Emerging markets are becoming the primary testing grounds for "extreme adoption" scale in agentic workflows. Culturally, the shift in narrative from AI as a threat to AI as an "observer" or "contained entity" reflects a significant change in how human-AI interaction is perceived.
