## 1. Flight Booking Strategy

### **When to Book**
*   **The "Golden Window":** Aim to book transatlantic flights **60 to 90 days prior to departure**.
*   **Wait for Confirmation:** Ensure flights are booked only after receiving official acceptance and confirmed academic calendar dates from the host institution.

### **Route Strategy**

### **Administrative Essentials**
1.  **Empadronamiento (City Registration):** Register with the local city hall immediately upon arrival.
