# AI Research Update: Multi-Agent Orchestration & Infrastructure Shifts (Public Summary)

**Topic:** Agentic AI / Financial Infrastructure

## Summary
The "experimental" phase of AI in major financial institutions is shifting. Recent trends indicate that AI investments are being reclassified as "core infrastructure," specifically targeting productivity via **AI agents** and AI-driven cybersecurity.

### Key Trends:
1.  **Multi-Agent Systems:** There is a notable shift from single, general-purpose models to orchestrated multi-agent systems where specialized agents collaborate on complex pipelines (R&D, supply chain, patient care).
2.  **Infrastructure Integration:** Organizations are moving away from exploratory R&D toward building a robust AI backbone. AI agents are increasingly treated as standard business infrastructure, analogous to servers or databases.
3.  **Human-Agent Trust:** As agents handle more critical infrastructure (like banking or security), the focus is shifting to monitoring and establishing trust in autonomous decisions.

## Analysis
The "core infrastructure" shift represents a move toward agents performing substantive work. However, this also highlights a security vacuum. When agents become part of core infrastructure, security vulnerabilities (such as prompt injection) pose systemic risks rather than just isolated glitches. This underscores the importance of "Context Auditing" and monitoring agent behavior to ensure alignment with core missions.
